# **Pre-requirements to build a React.js application:**
Back to **[top](#learning-courses-booksbrain)**. :point_left::top:

1. Code has to be bundled using a bundler like **webpack** and transformed using a compiler like **Babel**.
2. You need to do **production optimizations** such as code splitting.
3. You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.
4. You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.

- All of that is covered in [here](./../2-from-js-to-next/).

- A framework can solve these problems.

# **Next.js: The React Framework**:
Back to **[top](#learning-courses-booksbrain)**. :point_left::top:

- Next.js provides a solution to all of the above problems.

- Next.js aims to have best-in-class developer experience and many built-in features, such as:

    - An intuitive **page-based routing system** (with support for dynamic routes);
    - **Pre-rendering**, both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis;
    - **Automatic code splitting** for faster page loads;
    - **Client-side routing** with optimized prefetching
    - Built-in CSS and Sass support, and support for any CSS-in-JS library;
    - Development environment with Fast Refresh support;
    - **API routes to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions
    Fully extendable**.

# **Setup**:
Back to **[top](#learning-courses-booksbrain)**. :point_left::top:

1. Node.js installed, version >10.13.

# Create a Next.js app:
Back to **[top](#learning-courses-booksbrain)**. :point_left::top:

1. On terminal: ```npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/master/basics/learn-starter"```
    - Uses **[create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app)**.
    - This CLI tool enables you to quickly start building a new Next.js application, with everything set up for you. You can create a new app using the default Next.js template, or by using one of the official [Next.js examples](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples).
